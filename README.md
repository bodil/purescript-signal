# purescript-signal

Signal is a lightweight FRP-like library heavily inspired by the Elm Signal implementation. Where possible and sensible, it tries to maintain API equivalence with Elm.

See [the Elm documentation](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/3.0.0/Signal) for details on usage and principles.

## PureScript Usage Patterns

PureScript depends on effects (specifically, the `Eff` monad) to manage side effects, where Elm's runtime generally manages them for you. `purescript-signal` provides the `Signal.runSignal` function for running effectful signals.

```purescript
module Main where

import Control.Monad.Eff.Console
import Control.Monad.Eff
import Prelude
import Signal

hello :: Signal String
hello = constant "Hello Joe!"

helloEffect :: forall eff. Signal (Eff (console :: CONSOLE | eff) Unit)
helloEffect = hello ~> log

main = runSignal helloEffect
```

This simple example takes a constant signal which contains the string `"Hello Joe!"` and maps it over the `Control.Monad.Eff.Console.log` function, which has the type `forall eff. String -> Eff (console :: CONSOLE | eff) Unit`, thus taking the `String` content of the signal and turning it into an effect which logs the provided string to the user's console.

This gives us a `Signal (Eff (console :: CONSOLE | eff) Unit)`. We use `runSignal` to take the signal of effects and run each effect in turnâ€”in our case, just the one effect which prints `"Hello Joe!"` to the console.
