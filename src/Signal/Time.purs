-- |Returns the number of milliseconds since an arbitrary, but constant, time
-- |in the past.

-- |Takes a signal and delays its yielded values by a given number of

foreign import sinceP :: forall c a. (c -> Signal c) -> Time -> Signal a -> Signal Boolean

-- |Takes a signal and a time value, and creates a signal which yields `True`
-- |when the input signal yields, then goes back to `False` after the given
-- |number of milliseconds have elapsed, unless the input signal yields again
-- |in the interim.
since :: forall a. Time -> Signal a -> Signal Boolean
since = sinceP constant

-- |Takes a signal and a time value, and creates a signal which waits to yield
-- |the next result until the specified amount of time has elapsed. It then
-- |yields only the newest value from that period. New events during the debounce
-- |period reset the delay.
