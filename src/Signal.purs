-- |Merge two signals, returning a new signal which will yield a value
-- |whenever either of the input signals yield. Its initial value will be
-- |that of the first signal.
foreign import merge :: forall a. (Signal a) -> (Signal a) -> (Signal a)

-- |Merge all signals inside a `Foldable`, returning a `Maybe` which will
-- |either contain the resulting signal, or `Nothing` if the `Foldable`
-- |was empty.

-- |the input signal, and the previous value of the output signal, to produce
-- |the new value of the output signal.

-- |Create a signal which only yields values which aren't equal to the previous

-- |Create a signal which only yields values which aren't equal to the previous
-- |value of the input signal, using JavaScript's `!==` operator to determine
-- |disequality.
foreign import dropRepeats' :: forall a. (Signal a) -> (Signal a)

-- |Given a signal of effects with no return value, run each effect as it
-- |comes in.
foreign import runSignal :: Signal (Effect Unit) -> Effect Unit

-- |Takes a signal of effects of `a`, and produces an effect which returns a
-- |signal which will take each effect produced by the input signal, run it,
-- |and yield its returned value.
foreign import unwrap :: forall a . Signal (Effect a) -> Effect (Signal a)

-- |Gets the current value of the signal.
foreign import get :: forall a . Signal a -> Effect a

-- |Takes a signal and filters out yielded values for which the provided
-- |predicate function returns `false`.
foreign import filter :: forall a. (a -> Boolean) -> a -> (Signal a) -> (Signal a)

-- |Map a signal over a function which returns a `Maybe`, yielding only the
-- |values inside `Just`s, dropping the `Nothing`s.

-- |Turns a signal of arrays of items into a signal of each item inside
-- |each array, in order.
